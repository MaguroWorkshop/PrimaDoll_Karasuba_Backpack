What you will need are : N52 Magnets 10x4mm (8pcs), Hex M4x22 (6pcs), Hex M4x50 (4pcs), Hex M4x55 (2pcs), Hex M3x22 (6pcs), M4 Nuts (12pcs), M3 Nuts (6pcs)

Superglue or epoxy to glue the parts together. Pretty much straight forward assembly. Print 3pcs of BottleCap and BottleBottom. I use electrical conduit for the pipes. The hose is 20mm OD and 15mm ID.

Note : Im a newbie 3d modeller using Tinkercad. My models won't be perfect and might need some work after printing.
